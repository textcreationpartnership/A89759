         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Eeting lately with ſeveral Printed Papers treating of Government, and conſidering the various products, differences, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions of theſe our times, I was not a little preſſed in my ſpirit to ſpeak or give forth my minde to publike view; wherein I have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laboured under ſtrong hope in the moſt ardent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſire of my moſt inmoſt ſoul, for the full recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling and uniting of all in one entire and perfect bond of peace and reſt; therefore hope I ſhall offend none, but fo from my ſoul beg that it may be thorowly view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, well and truely weighed and conſidered, and that with a perfect heart and upright minde.</p>
            <p>The path we are to walk in, hath not been troden theſe many yeers: we will therefore endeavour to take the light along with us, and to walk ſo much the more circumſpectly, eaſily, and gently; and the God of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> direct us in our way.</p>
            <p>I know that much is ſeldom without much folly; in a little there may be the leſs: I ſhall therefore labour brevity, and ſubmit the enſuing Diſcourſe of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115297:4"/>
yeers unto the judgement of my ancients.</p>
            <p>I ſhall forbear to diſpute the aſſertions, arguments, or advices of any in the point; but leave them to the conſideration of thoſe they moſt properly concern, and give the world my account of the matter, without (ſo much as poſſibly I may) taking any account of theirs.</p>
            <p>The matter to be treated of, is Government, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or Rule.</p>
            <p>Wherein I deſire we may all conſider,</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, What that we call <hi>Government, Authority,</hi> or <hi>Rule,</hi> properly and truely is.</item>
               <item>Secondly, Upon what baſis or foundation it may or can ſtand.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I care not to diſpute of Government, either this or that; as <hi>Monarchy, Ariſtocracie, Democracie,</hi> and the reſt; whether this, or that, or the other, be beſt, upon which there hath been ſo many Voluminous Diſputes, with little or no ſatisfaction either to the ſtanders by, or Diſputants themſelves.</p>
            <p>Nor yet care I for too narrow an enquiry into the true Etymologie of the words <hi>Government, Authority,</hi> and <hi>Rule;</hi> what their true import is, or what they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and hold forth unto us: neither into the two terms of <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>limited</hi> Governours or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I rather chuſe, in all things of this nature, to ſhorten diſputes, by laying aſide the Head, that we may come to the Heart.</p>
            <p>I like not (therefore would not acquaint my ſelf with thoſe notional aerial Diſputes in which men have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115297:4"/>
been and are ſo much exerciſed, like two accurate Fencers, that come upon the Stage onely ſhew each others nimble activity, curious fallacies, and neat ſlights in the feats of Arms: for verily I account it much belowe or unlike a man.</p>
            <p>Man, were he known, would be found a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and noble creature, then to make ſo many vain motions and profers in ſo vain a manner, or, as others, ſo many violent and ſtrong motions, many times alſo, to ſo little purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Let us then, I pray, like men, deſcend into our ſelves, leaving our heads behinde us, and conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, what we are: Then, about what: And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for what we diſpute, or (I had rather ſay) enquire, before we enter the Diſputation or Enquiry.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Let us conſider, we are men; which very word <hi>man</hi> I never ſpeak or think of, but verily it makes me to make a pauſe, and to conſider; and the more I do conſider, the more ſtill I cannot but ſtand and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>Man! what, Man! God's Image! what, God's Image! the moſt excellent, the moſt glorious, noble, and ſtable Piece in the whole Creation! the very true image, pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and rule of all things, and ſo lord of all!</hi> Gen. 1. 26, 28.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I beſeech you let us conſider what we diſpute about. We often have many long, tedious, hot, and fiery Diſputes, yea blowes and bloodſhed too, many times, about meer Sayings: one ſaith, This is beſt, or, This is right; another ſaith, That is; and a third and fourth, a third and fourth thing: when as, if
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115297:5"/>
duely weighed and conſidered, layd aright to its right Rule, Man, (O Man, where art thou, O thou Rule of all things?) neither perhaps would be found good or right.</p>
            <p>Oh therefore that Man would but conſider and go down into himſelf, before he make any progreſs forth from or out of himſelf! which thing alone, would prevent moſt, if not all our Quarrels and Diſputes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I would intreat, when we do diſpute or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, (which word I had rather always uſe) that we conſider for what it is we diſpute or enquire. I know all men will preſently anſwer, and ſay, It is for the Truth; that is, thou meaneſt, to finde out and diſcover the Truth, not to defend the Truth. It were no ſmall diſhonour, blot, or blemiſh unto Truth, to beg a Champion to defend it, for it is ſtrong enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it ſelf, as you have it confeſſed by the King, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Princes, Captains and Governours of an hundred and ſeven and twenty Provinces, in diſpute of what was ſtrongeſt, Whether Kings, Wine, Women, or Truth; and Truth carried it. And the Truth it ſelf bears witneſs full and clear unto it ſelf: it is a Sun, needs therefore nothing but a hand barely to hold it forth. But it is to finde out and diſcover the Truth: Thou do'ſt well, if thou do'ſt it ſoberly, quietly, and ſtilly, with meekneſs and moderation of ſpirit; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, we ſhall raiſe ſuch a duſt, ſuch clouds, foggs, and miſts, as will darken the eyes of our Underſtanding, that we ſhall not be able to judge of colours, nor to finde our way, which for certain we have loſt; witneſs our daily diſputes, queſtionings, and enquiries. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being now upon our enquiry, I again pray that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115297:5"/>
we may walk gently and eaſily, being as ſtrangers in a ſtrange land, and God is to be ſeen, found, and known, in each ſtep we take. In calmneſs there is clearneſs, and ſo I hope we ſhall finde our way the better and the ſooner.</p>
            <p>Theſe three things being taken along with us, we will hope that the Lord, who is our light, will meet us and direct us: for it is written, <hi>He is nigh unto them that fear him;</hi> and that <hi>He will be found of thoſe that ſeek after him.</hi> It is light we want, that is doubtleſs; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe can ſhew or bring us into our way again, that is as certain: It is then verily worth our ſeeking, and happie ſhall we be in finding. It is written in a certain place, <hi>In thy light ſhall we ſee light:</hi> To that light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſire we may all look, and again, by a ſtill, ſoft, and gentle motion, to make our return even to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of days, and ſee how we there ſtand.</p>
            <p>In the firſt of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> we have it thus: <hi>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth; and the heavens was without form, and void, and darkneſs was upon the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the waters. Then God ſaid, Let there be light, and there was light: and God ſaw the light that it was good. And God ſeparated the light from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the light he called Day, and the darkneſs he called Night.</hi> And in verſ. 16. it is ſaid, <hi>God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the leſs light to rule the night;</hi> and that <hi>he ſet them in the firmament of heaven to ſhine upon the earth, and to rule in the day and in the night, and to ſeparate the light from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There we finde, that the firſt word God gave forth,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115297:6"/>
when all things were in a Chaos or confuſion, was Light: <hi>Let there be light, and there was light.</hi> This then was, as appears, the firſt Creation, going forth, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of God, as the Scriptures teſtific.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> (in his firſt Chapter) witneſſeth the ſame thing: <hi>In the beginning</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was that Word.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>In the beginning, God.</hi> So then, in God was this Word, as <hi>John</hi> afterwards hath it: <hi>That Word,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was with God, and that Word was God; the ſame was in the beginning with God: All things were made by it, and without it was made nothing that was made. In it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was life, and the life was the light of men:</hi> and that <hi>the light ſhineth in the darkneſs,</hi> though <hi>the darkneſs comprehends it not:</hi> And that <hi>he was in the world;</hi> and that <hi>the world was made by him,</hi> though <hi>the world knew it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith the ſame thing: for, ſaith he, <hi>The earth was without form, and void; and darkneſs was upon the deep,</hi> Until <hi>the Spirit of God moved upon the waters;</hi> and then <hi>God ſaid, Let there be light, and there was light.</hi> So that it appears, the firſt word of God was Light, and that light was Life. <hi>John</hi> alſo calls it <hi>The firſt begotten of God:</hi> and ſo <hi>Moſes, The Spirit of God moved upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> And the firſt product was Light. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> calls it <hi>The image of the inviſible God,</hi> and <hi>The firſt begotten of every creature. By him,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>were all things created, which are in heaven, and which are in earth, things viſible and inviſible: All things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>were created by him and for him.</hi> Thus you ſee, that the firſt thing in which, by which, or through which God made the world, was Light; that was the firſt, that firſt in which, by which, and through which all things were made; by that ſelf-ſame muſt they be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115297:6"/>
ruled and governed, as we ſhall ſee anon; and that firſt was and is light.</p>
            <p>Light therefore as it appears, was the firſt going forth of God in and towards the Creation of the world, or that true image or pattern of himſelf, in, by and after which he made, or made manifeſt the world, and himſelf in the world, for that is one main inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent property or intrinſe nature and quality of light, to make manifeſt, even thoſe things which are not; As it is written, <hi>God calleth the things that are, as if they were not, and the things that are not, as if they were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that for which I produce theſe Scriptures is, that if it may be, we may diſcover and get a true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and knowledge of that we call Rule or Government, what it is.</p>
            <p>For we are very apt to miſ-underſtand and give an untrue interpretation, not onely of other mens words, but our own alſo.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore a little conſider by the things that are, as we finde them in the beginning. It is ſaid, as is before quoted, that God made two great lights, and and ſet them in the Firmament of the Heaven to ſhine upon the earth, and to Rule in the day and in the night.</p>
            <p>Now what the nature and property of their Rule and Government is, we finde and ſee day by day.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Light we ſee is diffuſive, it diffuſes it ſelf throughout the whole circumference of the Heavens, and ſhineth (as it is written) upon the earth, <hi>both upon the good and the bad, upon the juſt and the unjuſt;</hi> it giveth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115297:7"/>
ſo much of it ſelf into every veſſel, as it is capable to receive: ſo ſwallowing up, caſting out, or deſtroying the darkneſs and the death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is very attractive, nothing more, nay nothing ſo much, ſo ſtrongly, and yet ſo ſweetly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth, as the Light doth, and that becauſe it is moſt pleaſant and delightful to behold, as in a certain place it is written.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It, and it onely makes manifeſt, it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maketh manifeſt it ſelf, but all other things in and with it ſelf: and thus it ruleth, or is rule, guide, or governour to it ſelf and all things elſe.</p>
            <p>Rule or Government (then) in its true and proper nature (if I miſtake not) is to Guide, Rule, Govern, or Direct (for the words are Synonima's) the thing or things to be ruled or governed in their certain, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, true, juſt, and right way, to their certain, proper, true, juſt, and right ends.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is abſolutely neceſſary, that he who would Rule and Govern aright, do certainly know the very certain intrinſe nature, property, and quality of the thing or things to be Ruled and Governed, otherwiſe, in ſtead of Ordering, Ruling, and Governing them, he doth grievouſly diſturb and diſorder them; unrule, or make them unruly, as we uſe to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Government and Rule indeed, therefore, is not coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive or compulſive, but attractive and directive. It is not Rule or Government properly, to force or compel a thing to this, or that, or the other thing, beſides, againſt, or contrary to its own proper, true, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſe nature.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:115297:7"/>
            <p>For every abberration in nature is ſo much and ſo far deſtructive to, or a ruine and overthrow of nature, as that abberration or turning aſide thereof is, in the perſon or thing ſo forced and compelled by us No, this is diſorderly and unruly; and not onely ſo, but we do often thereby not onely turn aſide and turn away the thing or things from us, we would Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern to our uſe and ſervice, but alſo make, procure, cauſe, or occaſion them to be or become our hurt, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, loſs, and detriment, our deadly (as is uſually ſaid) foes and enemies.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it becometh and behoveth man to walk wiſely, ſoberly, and circumſpectly, with <hi>his eys in his head;</hi> that is, in his heart or center. Now you know what the Scripture ſaith, that as <hi>the head of the woman it the man,</hi> ſo <hi>the head of every man is God:</hi> and it is ſo.</p>
            <p>Let us then, I beſeech you, walk like our ſelves, as we are in and after the image of God, and ſo Lords, Rulers, and Governours in and over the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam,</hi> he did give names unto all things brought before him, as you may read in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. No more.</p>
            <p>But let us in the light of the Lord move on gently and eaſily, ſo ſhall we the better finde and ſee our way, and keep our feet and foundation the ſurer.</p>
            <p>They are very haſty, hurrying, ſlippery times, wherein many have loſt their way. It is enough to the wiſe; and time is precious.</p>
            <p>And after God had thus, in, with, and by the light,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115297:8"/>
appeared, brought forth, or made manifeſt himſelf, in and by all things in the Heavens, and in the waters, and in the earth, according to their various kinds, forms, ends, and uſes, he then made, or made manifeſt man: <hi>Come,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let us make man in our image, according to our likeneſs,</hi> that he may bear the full impreſs, image, or character of our ſelf in the whole Creation, and ſo have the Rule and Dominion over the ſame; let him be the Center from whence the whole Circumference may be ruled, guided, and governed. And in truth, were not man ſuch, he could not have had the Rule and Dominion; for he who rules without contradiction, muſt have the ſupremacy of light and life over the things ruled.</p>
            <p>In ver. 26. it is written, <hi>Let us make man in our image, according to our likeneſs; and let him rule,</hi> &amp;c. In ver. 27. it is written thus: <hi>God created the man in his image, in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There you have the rule, pattern, or ſampler of all things brought forth or made manifeſt: for, ſaith he, <hi>Let us make man in our image, according to our likeneſs;</hi> and ſo as he was in, after, or according to the image or likeneſs of God, let him be a Rule, Guide, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in and unto himſelf and all things elſe.</p>
            <p>And if any further Rule and Government be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto man ſince that time, then is there expreſſed, I know not of it, but muſt ſay, If one man do excerciſe Lordſhip or Kingſhip over another, as Chriſt in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, <hi>it was not ſo in the beginning;</hi> and alſo what he ſaith in the ſame caſe to his Diſciples, that <hi>although the Gentiles did ſo, it ſhould not be ſo with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:115297:8"/>
            <p>It will be found, I believe, upon due conſideration, a grand and groſs miſtake, (as I have already ſaid) to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute rule and government unto the Head; if our meaning by the head be the top, uppermoſt, or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermoſt part of the body, certainly that is altogether uncapable of the rule and government of the body.</p>
            <p>For it is too high, and at too great a diſtance from the feet, which are mainly to be intended, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>Rule and Government, I believe, will be found, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſearch and inquiry, to lie in the heart, it being the center of the body, and the ſeat and center of light and life in the body: the government of the head, which (may I not ſay) it hath uſurped over the heart, is that which hath and doth diſorder and undo us.</p>
            <p>And, to ſpeak truth, it cannot rule and govern it ſelf, as experience day by day doth abundantly manifeſt.</p>
            <p>If the firſt in order of Cauſes be not juſt and right, certain and true, ſtable and fixt; that or thoſe things which iſſue forth from it, have their dependancy, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rule, guidance, or Government by it and from it, muſt of neceſſity be at leaſt ſo much and ſo far unjuſt, irregular, uncertain, unſtable and untrue, as is their or its firſt moving cauſe. Take it in Naturals, in Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials, in Civils, or Politiques as it is called.</p>
            <p>That which is not right it ſelf, cannot poſſibly make another right: wherefore it is written, <hi>Firſt pull out the beam that is in thine own eye, and then,</hi> &amp;c. and that <hi>a corrupt fountain cannot ſend forth pure ſtreams.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:115297:9"/>
            <p>Who can draw a ſtrait and certain line by a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and uncertain rule!</p>
            <p>I am unwilling to ſpeak of abſolute and unlimited Governours or Governments, nor ſhall I diſpute which is beſt, fetching arguments from this or that, or the other convenience or inconvenience which perhaps may be, and perhaps may never be, in which there is the greateſt and uncertaineſt of varieties that can be imagined; that is not mans work, but to fear the Lord, and do the thing that is right and juſt, and that juſtly and rightly too, as to the way alſo, for the way and the end muſt be one, both juſt, and juſtly done: this is mans center and reſting place, from which he may not move nor be moved leſt he die.</p>
            <p>In the beginning we finde not any thing in the whole Creation, as we have it recorded in the Scriptures that was not limited, bound, or circumſcribed, even he who had the Rule, Dominion, or Lordſhip in and over all, had his bounds and limits ſet him, for it is written, <hi>Of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou ſhalt not eat, for in the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt die the death:</hi> and whether the entertaining of our ſelves with, the putting or going forth of our ſelves in, ſuch imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, be not the eating the fruit of that tree, I leave to be conſidered of. What other limits <hi>Adam</hi> had, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſpeak; you may finde them as you go.</p>
            <p>Man indeed is a very free creature, when he is indeed &amp; in truth himſelf: it lieth not in this to do <hi>quicquid libet,</hi> what he liſt, but <hi>quod licet,</hi> what is juſt and right. Man may be a ſlave to his luſts and paſſions, and as much bound in and unto them, as in or unto any chain or fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:115297:9"/>
            <p>And to ſpeak truth, there is no good thing in the whole Creation, which is not circumſcribed, bound and limited, neither indeed can there be: God himſelf, if I may ſo ſpeak, to which the Scripture everywhere bears witneſs, hath bound himſelf within the golden chains of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And he which breaks, and ſo is without limit, may moſt properly and truly be called a Devil, or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for he hath broken the bond of union or oneneſs, wherein onely conſiſteth reſt and happineſs, and ſo is caſt forth or left out to torment himſelf, and to be tormented with his own boundleſneſs.</p>
            <p>I conclude, to me it appears that in the beginning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing in the whole Creation had its bounds and limits, and that by or in the breach thereof, man broke himſelf, broke his reſt, his peace, his glory, Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Dominion, and by his return, he returns to that he loſt.</p>
            <p>And to ſpeak the truth, the bound or limit makes every thing to be, and to be what it is; and without, it is nothing, a meer Chimera, a deep gulf, a bottomleſs pit or abyſs of thick darkneſs, for the mind to perplex and torment it ſelf endleſly in creating, forming, or imaging to it ſelf all things, any thing it may or can, and yet in truth nothing.</p>
            <p>Man, were he indeed himſelf, that is, were he in his true and proper place, in his true and proper center, for then, and then onely is he his true and proper ſelf, he would be found in all things and all times, to ſhew or give forth himſelf in the perfection of juſtice and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as fully and freely as the Sun doth his light.</p>
            <p>For without doubt it is his being, as witneſſeth the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115297:10"/>
Scripture, it is written, <hi>God made man perfect, but he hath found out many inventions</hi> (poor man) and we all know that that whoſe being is perfect, if it be it ſelf, cannot chuſe but act and give forth it ſelf perfectly. It is its being.</p>
            <p>Turn it which way you will or can, it is bound, it is limited.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>It is a Garden encloſed, high are the Walls, ſtrong are the Gates, wherewith it is ſurrounded and encompaſſed.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Yet it ſees, knows, underſtands and acts all things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>But is neither ſeen, known, underſtood, nor acted with or by any thing but it ſelf.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But no more, leſt—</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I have given you the diſcovery my ſelf hath made concerning Government, what in its true proper nature quality, end, and uſe it is. And in the way (though much more larger then I intended) ſomething of what man in his true and proper being is.</p>
            <p>I have alſo in this our enquiry forborn to diſpute the ſayings of others, finding little therein except the ingendring of endleſs ſtrifes and contentions, but have as plainly and briefly as I well might lead you to the Spring or Fountain-head, to the beginning of things, where you will finde the water leaſt troubled, or mudded by our foul and beaſtly heads, and ſo the more pure and cleer.</p>
            <p>Neither have I diſputed, as they call it, nor ſhall I in the enſuing Diſcourſe, for victory or maſtery, or to defend the Truth, as we uſe to ſay, but leave that to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and defend it ſelf; but as I have done, ſo I hope I ſhall onely make a bare inquiry after the good old
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115297:10"/>
way, in which our fathers walked and had peace.</p>
            <p>And I think we ſhall finde it thus: that which appears and manifeſts it ſelf to be the center, that is or ſhould be the onely and alone rule, guide, and governour of the whole circumference, and all their eys either do or ſhould do, ſtand ſtrongly and firmly ſet and fixed into or unto it; and the ſtronger and ſtabler the center unto any thing is, the better is the governance, and ſo the longer its continuance.</p>
            <p>And the Center I take to be that from whence the ſeveral individuals iſſue forth, and into or unto which they do or ſhould again return, for there muſt be no vacancy there.</p>
            <p>We have found in the beginning, that man not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had the rule, guide, and governance of himſelf, in himſelf, given him by God, but of all other things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: nor, as we there finde, and is already ſhewed, was there any rule or government given unto him over any other man or men; nor indeed appears there any need.</p>
            <p>The firſt we read of in the Scripture, who uſurped and exerciſed that Power and Dominion, was <hi>Nimrod,</hi> which was alſo after the flood, and that neer 2000 yeers after the Creation, as is believed by all or moſt.</p>
            <p>What ground, baſis, or foundation ſhall we then now finde, to ſettle a Rule or Government upon? or where ſhall we finde a Center wherein we may now ſtay and reſt our ſelves, in point of government, in reference to mankinde?</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:115297:11"/>
            <p>In this inquiry, let us not forget that which we have already found and diſcovered; and I think we have found this, That in the beginning, as all things were made in relation to each other, ſo all things were ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and governed according to the ſeveral relations each thing had unto other, according to the Laws and Ordinances thereof.</p>
            <p>For Rule or Government is a Relative, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as our relations are, ſo is or ſhould be the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or government of our ſelves, in reference to our ſelves, and thoſe we are related to.</p>
            <p>And ſo in ſpeaking or making any thing a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Government, you ſpeak it and make a Relative; and ſo binde and limit it, form and faſhion it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which you have or would relate it to.</p>
            <p>All things in the beginning related unto man, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the very eſſence and being of all things, as in an Epitome, wrapped up in himſelf; as he was in the image or likeneſs of God; in reſpect whereof, he had the rule and government of all things given unto him, and ſo was made after, bound up and limited in and unto them.</p>
            <p>For every thing and all things were juſt and juſtly made, in a due and true aſſimilation, and proportion each to other; otherwiſe could not God have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced that definitive ſentence on them, when he had looked them all over again, or reviewed them, that they were <hi>all good, very good;</hi> yea, and put his ſeal to it alſo, wherein he pronounced them fully, wholly, and altogether, in every jot and tittle compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>For he reſted the ſeventh day: which otherwiſe he could not poſſibly have done.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:115297:11"/>
            <p>In all our way we have hitherto gone, we finde not any ſuperiority of Eſſence or being in man kinde: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this I finde, that it is thus written; <hi>Thou ſhalt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the Land which the Lord thy God hath given thee:</hi> and ſo throughout the Scriptures this command is continued, and bleſſings and curſes accordingly pronounced and executed upon the breakers and keepers thereof: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that we <hi>reverence the aged, gray, and hoary head.</hi> And verily it is good ſo to do, being thereby taught and led to have our eys fixed upon <hi>the Antient of days,</hi> Him, even him from whom we had our being, and did come, and to whom again we muſt return.</p>
            <p>To the beginning of things theſe preceps direct, and I verily believe, upon due conſideration had, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch and inquiry made, we ſhall finde old things well worthy our looking after and into, and of much greater price and value, then to be caſt away, thrown aſide, and rejected as things of no worth, as is too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in theſe our days.</p>
            <p>Yet in that which I have ſaid, I deny not, but grant and conclude, that as there hath been, ſo there is and may be hereafter differences and diſtinctions in and with men: <hi>all are not eys, nor feet, nor head,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For then where were the body?</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks: all have not the like meaſure of ſeeing and underſtanding, have not the like meaſure of wiſdom and knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet every one hath (as may upon good grounds be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) enough in himſelf, in reference to himſelf, though perhaps not ſo much to things without him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in reference unto others. If it be not ſo, it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it will be ſo: for it is written, <hi>We ſhall be all taught
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115297:12"/>
of God,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſhall not need to teach one another,</hi> &amp;c. Amen:</p>
            <p>Seeing it is thus, as hath before been ſaid, that God hath not given, as we can finde, any Rule, Power, and Dominion unto one man over another, where then ſhall we fix our Government?</p>
            <p>Verily I for my part can finde no true, certain, and fixt center, ground, or foundation anywhere, but in him from whom I came; no being in peace and reſt, but in him who gave me a being.</p>
            <p>Thither, even thither therefore, will I go; to him, even to my Fathers houſe, after all my wandrings: I, prodigal that I am, will now make my return, hoping, nay ſted faſtly believing, that where, from whom, and from whence I had my being, if anywhere, I ſhall there, even there, finde my reſt, peace, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being.</p>
            <p>I confeſs my ſelf an Engliſhman, born unto, and under the protection of the Engliſh Laws, bred up in <hi>England;</hi> and that what I have and am, I have and am by vertue of the Engliſh Laws left and bequeathed unto me by my Fathers, who were alſo Engliſhmen: by them onely have I been many times kept and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from ruine and deſtruction, by the unjuſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive proceſs of unjuſt and oppreſſive men: nor may I forget what my Father was uſed to ſay to me, <hi>That if I would keep and ſecure the Law, the Law would keep and ſecure me;</hi> whom I may not but honour.</p>
            <p>For he lives, though dead; and it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt honour,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>And verily, in all my ſeekings and enquiries, I can finde no ſure, certain, or ſtable ground, baſis, or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for Government, in its true and proper nature (as before we have found and defined it) to be ſet and fixt upon, but our Fathers; there it may, there it will, nay there (give me leave to ſay without preſumption or offence to any) there onely it can ſtand, and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, No man had any rule or government given him by God or Nature over another man, as we have already by inquiry found: Therefore no man on earth had or could have over us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, but our Fathers, as our Fathers, both by God and Nature, had the rule and government given unto them over us their children, as their children.</p>
            <p>For the firſt had and ſtill hath, and it onely and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone hath the rule and government of the ſecond. The ſecond being in, from, by, or upon the firſt, and yet theſe two but one in their true center: hence ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I and the Father are one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt, and it onely (in the foundation, order, or courſe of nature, and all things elſe) is, and of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt be; ſo that nothing elſe poſſibly can be the ground, baſis, foundation and center, and ſo the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Governour, Guider, and director of the ſecond; and ſo in order iſſuing forth from, and returning again into their center.</p>
            <p>Which order being intirely kept and preſerved, there is and of neceſſity muſt be everlaſting ſtrength, peace, and reſt unto a people or perſon; but if once we break or depart hence, we are undone, or, if you will, ruined and deſtroyed.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:115297:13"/>
            <p>Hence it is we have throughout the Scriptures ſuch ſtrict commands to <hi>honour</hi> and obey <hi>our fathers,</hi> to <hi>keep the Statutes, Judgements, and Ordinances of our Fathers:</hi> hence alſo, as is already ſaid, ſuch promiſes and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings annexed to the keepers and obſervers thereof, and ſuch threatnings and curſes unto thoſe who break and depart from them.</p>
            <p>Here now you ſee the ground and reaſon of it; and, my brethren, let me tell you, God neither commands nor requires any irrational, or (if that word offend) unreaſonable thing of us; nor forbids he us any thing but what is in it ſelf, in its very nature, eſſence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hurtful or prejudicial to us.</p>
            <p>But poore man hath and doth ſo darken his own eys, that he doth not nor cannot yet ſee it; but we will hope he ſhall ſee it, and rejoyce in it: hence we ſay of God, that <hi>he is a hard Maſter:</hi> Oh let us ſay ſo no more; for verily he is good, very good unto, in, and over all his works.</p>
            <p>But man, man, man, that is gone from his Maker, from his Father, is now become very feeble and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted; having loſt his foundation, gone from his Center, he begins now to work and ſet up for himſelf; he falls a creating, or imaging foundations and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (if I might ſo call them) for himſelf and others; and he now muſt be King and Soveraign, Governour and Ruler: thus he being divided in himſelf, he builds up <hi>Babylon</hi> and confuſion (and cannot otherwiſe do) firſt in himſelf, in his own imaginations; there he forms Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances, and theſe muſt men be governed by; and one is for this, and another
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115297:13"/>
for that, and another for another thing.</p>
            <p>But poor man ſees not, thought it is ſo plainly told him, that <hi>the imaginations of the heart of man are evil, and onely evil, and that continually.</hi> I beg and beſeech you all to ceaſe unto them, and to reſt at quiet in and with your ſelves; for all you do is of the foundation; nothing will nor can ſtand firm, faſt, and ſteady, which is not fully, wholly, and perfectly in and upon the firſt.</p>
            <p>Now let us not be aſhamed to confeſs and ſay, with good old <hi>Jacob, Hitherunto hath the Lord holpen us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By him it is we have now recovered a ſight of our deſired reſt, diſcovered a plain, cleer, and fair founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ground, and baſis for government or rule, to ſtand upon, and center in.</p>
            <p>Ye the people of this Nation, even ye Engliſh men, by what names or titles ſoever now in theſe ſad divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding times called or diſtinguiſhed, I do earneſtly and heartily beg, and beg, and beg again, again, and again, upon my bare knees, of all and every one, that you would make ſome pauſe and ſtop a while, and ſo go down into your ſelves, and ſeriouſly conſider what is or may be the cauſe or the occaſion of theſe our very much to be lamented breaches, diſtractions and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: we have had breach upon breach, and breach upon breach, and ſtill we are more and more diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and divided.</p>
            <p>One man lays it here, and another there, and a third elſe where; one upon this man, another upon that man, and a third upon a third: but may it not be this?</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:115297:14"/>
            <p>That we have all of us broken and are departed from the Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances of our Fathers, (verily this is it) that we are gone aſtray, and have loſt our way, even the way our Fathers commanded, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and appoynted to us; what elſe meaneth and ſpeaketh all theſe inquiſitions or inquiries?</p>
            <p>If they were onely inquiries, they were good; but Oh what meaneth thoſe ſo many propoſitions, almoſt every day publiſhed, tendered, and offered for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! the Land is everywhere full of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are we every day more and more diſtracted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in our ſelves, and from one another.</p>
            <p>Verily it extreamly troubles me; ſurely men are not a little beſide themſelves. What, propound Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours or Governments, Laws, Ordinances and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions to Engliſh men!</p>
            <p>It is the higheſt attempt (that I ſay not affront) that ever was undertaken, done, or offered by any Engliſh man or men unto this Engliſh Nation.</p>
            <p>What, murder and deſtroy our fore-Fathers in their beſt, moſt pure, upright, perfect, innocent, lively, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting being! <hi>O monſtrum horrendum</hi>! reject, deſpiſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn, throw and caſt away the foundation by them laid in the beginning of time, upon which they and their childrens children after them have ſtood upon and centered in to this day!</p>
            <p>I dare onely deſire, that we may obey the commands of the Lord, and therein the Laws, Statutes, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of our fore-Fathers.</p>
            <p>Brethren, that which ſtands faſt upon, or fixed in its center and foundation, cannot poſſibly be removed or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115297:14"/>
ſhaken (behold out eys this day ſee this thing) nor can it reſt, but is ſtill tottering and ſhaking, until it finde its center and foundation again: and moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is that man, perſon, nation, or people, that have thereunto attained; and for ever happy, if they keep there.</p>
            <p>Now let us conſider, are we not all built upon the foundation of our Fathers? If we have any founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all, it muſt needs be ſo; for there is not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there be any other laid by any. Are not they our onely proper and true center, foundation, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place:</p>
            <p>They will not, they cannot come unto us: but we may, nay we muſt return unto them, and unto our ſelves in them, if we will live and not die.</p>
            <p>Here may Engliſh men, even all Engliſh men, thus miſerably divided and diſtracted <hi>England,</hi> meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and unite, and be united again, even as one man.</p>
            <p>One in and with our ſelves, and one in and with our forefathers alſo; for our forefathers, and we in and with our forefathers, (Note) and our forefathers in and with us, will be found in the Laws, Ordinances, Cuſtoms, and Conſtitutions mutually agreed, firmly and ſtrongly knit, tyed, and bound up together.</p>
            <p>For as they in, by, and through them, brought, made, and gave forth the very true, real Eſſence and Being of their very true, real, and proper ſelves, in which they would live as in the beſt, trueſt, livelieſt, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115297:15"/>
everlaſting image of that their moſt real, very, true, proper, and unſpotted ſelves, to remain and abide to all generations for ever.</p>
            <p>So we alſo did therein and thereby bring, make, and give forth the ſame very, true, real, Eſſence and Being of our very, true, real, and proper ſelves, together, in, and with them, as we were in their loyns; as you ſhall have it proved by Scripture by and by: and verily they were not without us, nor we without them.</p>
            <p>Here now is a conjunction and union indeed, and to the purpoſe; here is now light, life, and ſtrength not to be loſt or overcome: mine eys wait to ſee this thing, and ſhall not our eys ſee it, and rejoyce in it? even ſee all, however now divided, diſtinguiſhed, and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, made thus one again, in and with the Lord, in and with our forefathers, in and with our ſelves, and one in and with one another.</p>
            <p>The ancient Cuſtoms, Laws, and Conſtitutions of this Nation, are they not our Fathers, even our firſt fathers, the birth-right and inheritance of us their children, in which and unto which we were born and bred? and I hope an <hi>Eſau</hi> will not be found in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are the Deeds, Evidences, and Legacies of our forefathers, The laſt Will and Teſtament of our forefathers, in which they have bequeathed themſelvs unto us their children, even their pure and unſpotted mindes, hearts, and ſpirits, that they might live in us, and we in them, from generation to generation for ever.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:115297:15"/>
            <p>The things that we ſpeak, my brethren, are no fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or chimera's, but they are certain undenyable Truths, that will bear the fiery tryal, and approach of the cleereſt Sun that ever did or can ſhine, and Truths of the higheſt and greateſt concernment unto us of any thing in the world.</p>
            <p>They are the ancient Land-marks of our Fathers; and now our land marks, our bounds and buttings; and who may alter or remove them? We know the penalty, the woful curſe that is pronounced againſt ſuch; and that <hi>he that breaks the hedge, a ſerpent ſhall bite him.</hi> And ſee we not this day, even this day, all theſe things made good before our eys?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How many Oh how many have been bit and ſtung, and ſtung to death, in this doing</hi>!</p>
            <p>Verily, I never knew, read, or heard of any people or Nation, but when once they came to ſwerve (let it be examined) and depart from the Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances of their Fathers, but they were by and by ruined, undone, and deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>And it muſt be ſo, and cannot be otherwiſe: for they who depart their foundation, cannot ſtand; they who abide not in their center, are loſt and undone undenyably: the Scripture throughout witneſſeth this this thing; and it muſt be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, that Nation or people who kept firm and faſt to the Laws, Cuſtoms, and Ordinances of their Fathers, and them inviolate, kept faſt in and upon their foundation and center, were therein and thereby kept in ſafety, peace, ſecurity, and reſt for ever.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:115297:16"/>
            <p>I have ever accounted the Laws, Cuſtoms, and Conſtitutions of the Nation, very ſacred (and I have now given you the reaſon of it) and indeed ſo ſacred, as not to be violated to ſave the Nation, (ſhould ſuch an emergency happen.) If it were fit and convenient to be examined, or to put them in the balance together, I am apt to think the Laws, Cuſtoms, and Conſtitutions of the Nation, would prove moſt weighty: and if a Sacrifice of the one muſt be made to ſave the other, the Nation, with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> muſt to the Altar: for <hi>obedience is better then ſacrifice;</hi> and out <hi>of ſtones can God raiſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>But I love not to diſpute of things that are not;</l>
               <l>And of things that be or are, there is no cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The things that be or are, are Onely ours,</l>

            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:115297:16"/>
            <p>And what our Fathers judgement and practice was in the caſe, is cleer and evident, that is ours; for it doth remain, therefore ſtill is, and we may look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p>And certainly, as our fathers, and we in them, (for as we have before ſaid, they are not without us, nor we without them) made, conſtituted, appointed, and ordained the Laws, Cuſtoms, Ordinances, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Nation, and thereby gave them a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo alſo did thoſe Laws, Cuſtoms, Ordinances, and Conſtitutions, give both them and us a being, made and conſtituted them and us a Commonweale. It was ſo indeed in and from the beginning: the word is an old word, and it is a good word; they had both word and thing, thing and word; ſo I hope ſhall we their children alſo: they are Relatives, and the one is not nor may not be without the other: if you depart from them, you depart from your ſelves; and how can you but periſh?</p>
            <p>Every man whatſoever, let his degree, place, eſtate, quality, and condition be what it will among men, ſo much &amp; ſo far as he ſwerves and departs from them, ſo much and ſo far he ſwarves and departs from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and all things that he calls or can call his.</p>
            <p>If we deſtroy the one, we deſtroy the other; for they are an one or an union; and union is all that can be ſpoken, all ſtrength, all harmony, all light and life.</p>
            <p>We have now, I hope, by our inquiry found, and do fully and cleerly now ſee, what Government in its true and proper nature is, and upon what ground, baſis, and foundation it ſtands.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:115297:17"/>
            <p>Nay, we have now brought you to this, even plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cleerly to ſee, that as we finde not any Rule or Dominion given unto one man over another in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, neither is it ſo now here.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Paul</hi> hath it in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 9, 10. <hi>To ſay as the thing is, Levi which receiveth Tythes, paid Tythes in Abraham, for he was yet in the loyns of his father Abraham, when Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedek met him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ſay I, Each and every man of us, as we were in the loyns of our forefathers, ſtanding ſeverally and diſtinctly in and upon our ſelves, gave forth, made, or made manifeſt our ſelves, what our own, proper, and true minde was, in thoſe Laws, Cuſtoms, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and Conſtitutions given forth, uſed, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, wherein they would as in themſelves, ſo each unto other (each one ſtill keeping his one Royalty or Regality in his own proper O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Such, my Brethren, are and will be found the Laws, Ordinances, Cuſtoms, and Conſtitutions of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</p>
            <p>Here in this Center, upon this baſis and foundation is no tranſgreſſor nor tranſgreſſion found, no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord, Governour, or Ruler over another, but each and every man Lord and Ruler in and over himſelf

and Brethren, one in, with, and unto another; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one doing as he would be done unto, acting and walking (as I may ſay) in plain ſimplicity, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Road, to the view of all; being herein alſo (as before is ſhewed) tyed and knit together in one intire unity, to the good, well being, and preſervation as of the whole, ſo of each particular in the whole.</p>
            <p>Here now is no more a diviſion in two or more, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> againſt <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim;</hi> but it is One, One, One; a moſt abſolute, intire, and perfect One.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Men, Fathers, and Brethren,</hi> I ſpeak, or deſire to ſpeak, even to you all, and every one in and of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Have we not all ſtrayed and wandered like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals as we are, from that good old way in which our Fathers walked and had peace; from, even from our forefathers houſe? And what have any of us gotten, except wounds and bruiſes? Have we not ever ſince been feeding upon husks, upon the wind: Elſe why is it we are not ſatisfied?</p>
            <p>Come, Oh come, and let us all return, that we may eat bread, and that <hi>in our Fathers houſe, where,</hi> verily
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115297:18"/>
               <hi>there is enough;</hi> and ſo live, and not dye.</p>
            <p>Are we not all found breakers down, pluckers up, and removers of the Ancient bounds and Land-marks our forefathers ſet and gave unto us? have we not left and forſaken the plain, beaten, known, open, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Road by them made and laid out unto us, and ſo have grievouſly treſpaſſed upon and againſt our ſelves and each other, and ſo have been beaten, wounded, torn, ſlain, conſumed, and deſtroyed by each other? Which, Oh which of us all are cleer in this matter?</p>
            <p>What have we therefore now to do, but to confeſs our tranſgreſſions, to repent and return, and to beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and mercy of the Lord, and of one another, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving from the heart each others treſpaſſes, as we would God ſhould pardon and forgive us? We have entred into and upon each others houſes and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, without their privity, liking, or conſent, and therein have we much Lorded it over our brethren, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the command of God, and the Laws, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Ordinances, and Conſtitutions of our Fathers: both Magiſtrates and Miniſters (as they are now called and diſtinguiſhed) yea and people too, have grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſgreſſed herein.</p>
            <p>I for my own part do ſeriouſly and indeed acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my ſelf a tranſgreſſor, and therefore do earneſtly and heartily beg mercy and pardon both of God and all men, and do freely forgive all men, as I would the Lord ſhould forgive me.</p>
            <p>The next thing we have to do, is, to return into the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115297:18"/>
good old way again, in which our Fathers walked, and had peace.</p>
            <p>Is it not? verily it is the very true ground, baſis, and foundation upon which we may all ſtand ſafe and ſecure; the truly juſt, right, and proper center, in which, without any the leaſt ſuſpitions, jealouſies, and ſurmiſes each of other, we may all meet upon plain and even ground, ſhake hands and kiſs each other like Brethren: there we are Brethren, nay there we and our Fathers are One.</p>
            <p>Here are all parties whatſoever reconciled, all names except that of Brethren, all intereſts except the joynt intereſt of the whole, laid aſide, all quarrels and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions ended: here is no more diſputing about this and that, and the other thing, what Governours and Governments we ſhall have: one ſaith this, another that: this way it muſt be to day, another way and thing tomorrow: this party and intereſt draws this way, another party and intereſt another way, and a third, a third way.</p>
            <p>Brethren (if I who am the leaſt of all your thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands may call you ſo) I beſeech you let us no more nor any longer trouble our heads, perplex and diſquiet our hearts about this matter: our forefathers have been and are better to us then we are aware of, or then we are or can be without them unto our ſelves; they have already provided all things neceſſary to our hands, ſo that in very deed we cannot poſſibly fall ſhort of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing we do want or can deſire, if our deſires be our own. There is enough to ſatisfie us all. For it is our Fathers houſe.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115297:19"/>
Have I not, who am the leaſt, if not leſs then the leaſt, been much too bold (I fear leſt I have) ſo many times, ſo importunately to plead with you, as I have paſſed on, in this my path? It is love, therefore pleads to be excuſed: and verily it is my love unto the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and my earneſt and hearty deſire of its welfare, and every particular perſon or member thereof; for I am enemy to none, but would gladly reconcile and unite all; and for whoſe perfect reconciliation and union, I ſhould willingly ſacriſice my life by a tormenting death.</p>

            <p>So ſay we, The Laws and Ordinances, the Cuſtoms and Conſtitutions of our Fathers, we cannot, we may not, we muſt not, nor we will not alter them nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, part with them, nor depart from them:</p>

               <l>For they are our Fathers.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And theſe are, muſt be, and ſhall be our Guides, our Rules, or, if you will, our Rulers and Governours; and we do not know, neither may we know any other: here are not two or more mock-Suns for us to gaze, ſet, or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115297:20"/>
fixe our eys upon, but onely one true Sun, one cleer and perfect light, and that or theſe the Laws, Statutes, Ordinances, and Conſtitutions of our Fathers, onely guide, rule, direct and govern us in all things.</p>
            <p>As how, in what manner, and in what meaſure, and for what uſes, and to what ends they are to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred; they direct us to and in the way, as well as to the end; and alſo they do direct the means, as by what perſons and Officers they are to be adminiſtred, and how thoſe perſons are to demean and carry themſelves in their adminiſtration, as alſo what perſons are to be choſen thereunto, and by whom thoſe perſons are to be choſen, and when, and at what time and times.</p>
            <p>They are the center of all our centers, being (as I think I ſaid before) that in which our forefathers, and we in them, in the very reality, truth, ſubſtance, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and being of our very hearts (the very true cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all light, life, and ſtrength in and unto our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body) joyntly met together, centered, thereby making one intire center, one onely eye, or ſingle eye, one ſingle heart, one cleer and pure fountain of light, life, and ſtrength in and unto the whole body: In or unto which center or one eye and heart, ſhould all our ſeveral and individual eys and hearts continually ſtand fixt and centered, as in their onely and alone very true and proper head, for <hi>the wiſe mans eys are in his head,</hi> that is, in his heart; in his center, there he onely lives; and from thence, in the light, life, and ſtrength thereof (if he be a perfect wiſe man) he onely and alone acts and goes forth.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:115297:20"/>
            <p>That we call the head, the higheſt or uppermoſt part of the body, it hath its proper place and office in the body, yet is but a figure or reſemblance of our true and very head, for that is our heart (as I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the wiſdom whereof is very great indeed, and it is excellently pute and good.</p>
            <p>The head, as the Moon, is the receptacle of all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibility: a dark, confuſed, changeable body, in and of it ſelf, receiving the influences of light and life, onely from another, from the Sun, from the heart, from the center; but is not the Sun, is not the heart, is not the center, and therefore is not the true, right, and proper Guide, Governour, &amp; Ruler, in of or unto the body: for indeed and in truth it appertaineth and belongeth only and alone unto, or is the very onely and alone true and proper work and office of the center, to order and rule, guide, govern, and direct the whole circumference, of which the head is onely a part or member.</p>
            <p>This therefore is, and this onely and alone is our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and alone true head, our onely and alone Guide and Governour, Rule or Ruler, and none elſe poſſible can be of or over, in and unto its circumference or whole body, and every particular member or officer in and of the ſame.</p>
            <p>In theſe, even in theſe, did the cleer and perfect light and life of our forefathers, as from the whole circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Heavens, meet, concenter, and imbody it ſelf, thereby making one moſt cleer and perfect Sun, in and unto this our Heaven or Horizon, ſetting it as it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115297:21"/>
were in the firmament of the Heaven, that ſo it might again remit, ſend forth, or give back, that its light, life, and ſtrength, into or unto the whole circumference, and to ſhine upon the earth, and to rule in the day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even unto us, and our childrens children after us for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: and indeed we being herein but one, there is not, neither may there be, any other center or foundation unto us, then onely and alone this one.</p>
            <p>This being indeed and in truth, the onely and alone Soveraign and Supreme, whom none may withſtand, nor ſtand againſt: in, by, through, and from which onely and alone, are all the other Creations, as of the moon, ſtars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (I mean the ſeveral Officers or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the body or Commonwealth) and unto or into which onely and alone, they are all again to be return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as into their onely and alone very, true, right, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per head, fountain, ſpring, and center; and ſo there alſo, or unto it, are they onely and alone accountable, and by it onely and alone to be tryed and judged, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted or condemned.</p>
            <p>For it, and it onely, is the very true, pure, and cleer light, and ſo the Lord and judge of and unto them all.</p>
            <p>There is not, neither muſt there be, by any means, upon any account whatſoever, any <hi>vacuum,</hi> intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or interpoſition here; but all is and muſt be in an exact round or circle, or a perfect and entire union, as we finde it was in the beginning.</p>
            <p>And to ſpeak the truth, as the truth is, man being made after the image of God, in his very likeneſs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and perfect; as he is ſuch, or ſo far and ſo much as he is ſuch, or as he retains and remains, or is again
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115297:21"/>
renewed and brought forth in that image, even ſo much and ſo far he doth form, faſhion, create, make, make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, or bring forth the very ſame image or likeneſs. For every thing doth bring forth its ſelf, its own image and likeneſs, and cannot do otherwiſe. But I muſt forbear farther to parallel things, leſt whilſt I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make things clear, obvious, and plain, I make them the more dark and obſcure: and I fear to break my limit.</p>

            <p>We will ſay no more; but this is all, and the only anſwer we will make to all; <hi>They are our Fathers.</hi> It was ſatisfactory and well-pleaſing unto God, in a thing of much leſs concernment to the <hi>Rechabites</hi> (if we might ſo ſpeak) then this is to us; and we doubt not but it will be ſo alſo in our caſe, and that we ſhall be held blameleſs in his ſight, and in the ſight of all men: onely I will take the boldneſs, for this once, to aver and ſay, They are the beſt in the whole world: neither would I at all doubt (were it not a ſin to diſpute them) to maintain and prove them ſo, with the hazard of my life, and that in the face of Heaven, before all the men on earth.</p>
            <p>My meaning is not of particular Statute-Laws, few whereof will be found to be centered in, or have any foundation upon the Laws, Cuſtoms, Ordinances, and Conſtitutions of our Fathers, but generally altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſides, againſt, and quite contrary thereunto.</p>
            <p>Nor ſay I, but that Parliaments may null theſe, or rather declare them null, although in truth, they are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115297:22"/>
null in themſelves; and no Court of Judicatory, no Officer or Miniſter of the Law, ought to put them in execution.</p>
            <p>It is a miſtake to think that Parliaments are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Laws; which cannot be, for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if they be any thing, &amp; that which they be, they be onely and alone in, by and from the Laws, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Ordinances, and Conſtitutions of our Fathers. Now that which hath its being in, from, and by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cannot it ſelf be the foundation, but muſt finde it ſelf centered and founded, and ſo limited, ſomewhere out of it ſelf, and ſo may not do any thing, but what doth certainly, plainly, and fully center and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf in that which gave it ſelf a being.</p>
            <p>To imagine that Laws were inſtituted, ordained, and appointed, to the hurt, prejudice, loſs, detriment, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and deſtruction of any, is a very groſs and grand miſtake, and extream injurious to the Laws themſelves, and their makers and inſtitutors, and a very great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of their true and proper uſe and end; their onely and alone true and proper uſe and end being, to direct, guide, and govern, and ſo to ſecure, guard, and protect all and every one, in innocency, truth, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, from and againſt any and all who ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe, violate, moleſt, trouble, and oppreſs them, and their native liberties therein. But becauſe we have principles of tyranny in our ſelves, we judge and would make them ſuch alſo: hence it is, that at ſome times, as that principle, or rather that unruly exorbitancy (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to it ſelf and others) hath taken place, born ſway and prevailed, have ſome Statutes or Laws (if I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115297:22"/>
might ſo call them) been made, which are quite off from, altogether againſt, contrary and deſtructive to the foundation, to the Laws, Cuſtoms, Ordinances, and Conſtitutions of our Fathers: which <hi>By Laws</hi> (as they are uſually called, for as is ſaid, they are not upon the foundation) have ever proved deſtructive to and ruine of their contrivers and makers: and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe, as I could plainly manifeſt, and the Scripture is full and plain in it everywhere, <hi>He who digs a pit for another, ſhall certainly and infallibly fall into it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and he who breaks the hedge, a ſerpent ſhall bite him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence alſo it is that Laws have been and are ſo often ſtretched and tentered, haled and pulled, rent and torn this way and that way, to ſerve the particular and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate uſes and ends of ſome private and particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, at ſome particular times and ſeaſons (for which, judgement hangs ſomewhere) whenas in truth, they ſhould be kept and maintained perfectly, upright, ever and always the ſame, alike to all, neither looking back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nor forward, this way or that way, but one pure ſimple act in it ſelf, ever and always, or in all times, and altogether unchangably the ſame; otherwiſe can none whomſoever poſſibly be ſafe and ſecure in them or by them. And if any ſuffer loſs, detriment and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, that is not properly in and by the Law, for that is good, that is light, life, ſafety, and protection, but herein we ſuffer, in forſaking, leaving or departing therefrom; and ſo going forth and betaking our ſelves unto, and falling into the evil, the darkneſs and the death, manifeſted and declared therein or thereby, are ruined and deſtroyed therewith.

I hope hitherto our ſeeking and inquiry hath not been fruitleſs or in vain, but we have at leaſt found and diſcovered thus much, what the very true, real, and proper ground, baſis, and foundation is, on which we may firmly ſtand with both feet, or the center in which we may all ſafely and ſecurely meet; and from thence the way in which we may ſecurely walk, and again make our returns: wherefore let us again ſay, with good old <hi>Iacob, Hitherto hath the Lord holpen us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having made diſcovery of our ground, baſis, and foundation again (which hath long lyen hid, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and buryed) and where and what our center is, we will ſurely and ſtedfaſtly there ſtand.</p>
            <p>And will no more, either by Kings, Prieſts, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, nor by God himſelf, be either courted, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, diſputed, or commanded from it or out of it any more. For it is our Fathers:</p>
            <p>And not the unlimited paſſions, luſts, and affections of any whatſoever, good or bad, that we are left or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed unto; nor yet the uncertain or unknown Cabinets of any man or mens breaſts whatſoever, no nor of God himſelf; for they are his, and his onely: <hi>ſecret things are, but revealed things</hi> (as we have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) they, and they onely, <hi>belong unto us and to our children,</hi> and our childrens children for ever after us.</p>
            <p>I ſhall onely ſay this farther, that were I enemy to any man or men in <hi>England,</hi> or in the whole world, and would deſign or endeavour, plot or contrive their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115297:23"/>
and overthrow, I would deſire and ſtrongly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he ſhould break his limit, and would by all the means I could, tempt, ſtir up, and entice him thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and endeavour, with as much induſtry as I could, to blow up that coal (which lies in every man, though in ſome and at ſome times more hid and obſcure) and to lay all thoſe taking materials unto it, which might excite, ſtir up, and increaſe that deſire of unlimitedneſs more and more: and this was the devil or Satans way with <hi>Adam</hi> in the beginning.</p>
            <p>But verily I love that moſt excellent and glorious piece, MAN, becauſe I in ſome meaſure know what he is, as before I have ſhown you. My love is to all mankinde; And I would from my ſoul, with the loſs of my own, that they might be all ſaved: but Oh that we might be ſaved altogether! ſuch a day I hope and believe is at hand.</p>
            <p>I love this Nation, and have it in my heart continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, (the Lord is my witneſs I lye not) and therefore would that it, even it, (it is but <hi>a little one)</hi> Oh yet, that it might be ſaved from the great conſumption and deſtruction that God is bringing upon the whole earth. I will yet bow, and bow, and bow my ſoul again, again, and again unto the Lord for this thing: yea, although he have ſaid that he will deſtroy it, I will yet with <hi>Iacob</hi> wreſtle; who knows but that I may prevail?</p>
            <p>Yet let me ſpeak the truth as the truth is (and I know what I ſpeak) there is but a little, but a very very little matter between us and death at this time; wherefore let, I beſeech you, the words of him who loves you,

not onely in this Land, but in many Lands, Nations, and Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak herein unto the Engliſh Army chiefly, whoſe moſt proper work this will perhaps be found to be: and let not your hearts faint herein, nor your hands grow weary in reference to the greatneſs of the work that lies before you, nor of any thing by any ſpoken againſt you; neither be you lifted up, I pray you, in or by any thing above your ſelves or brethren, by ought that is but either ſeemingly, or elſe indeed and in truth with you: let not the vain and empty words of vain and empty men have any power with you or upon you.</p>

            <p>In calmneſs there is cleerneſs: but yet, I ſay, do your work, and do it faithfully; and the Lord ſhall bleſs and proſper you, yea, and peoples, and Nations, and Kingdoms ſhall bleſs you, and their and your genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for ever ſhall bleſs you.</p>
            <p>And although perhaps you may not be the builders, be not therein diſcouraged: for the leveller of the way, or the breaker down, is as neceſſary as the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and the breaker down and leveller will be found to have the better wages; for it is juſt he ſhould, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his work is hardeſt. And God is juſt.</p>
            <p>And in truth, both the breaker down and builder up are but one, though in two diſtinct Offices, and for two diſtinct uſes: they are one in the beginning, and one in the end, yea and one in the way alſo; one in the hand of the Lord, and one in one another, as you have it cleer and plain in that Scripture, where it is ſaid, <hi>They had their ſwords in one hand, and their trowels in the other,</hi> whileſt they were building the Temple.</p>
            <p>Your hearts alſo which are the levellers, may be more upright with the Lord, then perhaps the builders are or may be; you have much the advantage of them many ways (as I could manifeſt, but I haſten:) it was ſo in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon: David</hi> was a very great Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller or breaker down, but <hi>David</hi> built not; yet <hi>David</hi> carries the Bell away in the ſight of the Lord, for <hi>a man whoſe heart was upright with the Lord,</hi> above <hi>Solomon</hi> and all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I remember it is recorded of an Engliſh King, I take it to be <hi>Ethelſtane,</hi> who after he had regained <hi>Scotland</hi> (ſubjected formerly to <hi>England,</hi> as a Dukedom thereof) makes it again a politique and real Kingdom, ſaying, <hi>It was more noble to make a King, then to be a King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What, will you level and make way for a King, the King of righteouſneſs, and Prince of Peace? why do ſo, and bleſſed are you in ſo doing. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
            <p>And ſurely if I make another happy, good, or glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, my happineſs, good, and glory may as much be ſeen, yea and have as real an exiſtencie therein alſo, if not more, then is in him whom I have made ſo.</p>
            <p>It is ſo with God; his glory, his goodneſs is as much ſeen and known, yea and more too, and hath as real an exiſtence in his things made, as the things he hath ſo made, poſſibly may or can have in their being made ſo: and Chriſt faith, <hi>Whoſo loſeth his life for my ſake, ſhall finde it ſevenfold.</hi>

            <p>Verily the world is full of vain, empty, trifling writings and diſputes (may I not call them ſo? ſurely I may, and not tranſgreſs:) but I hope the froth and vanity is almoſt ſpent and gone, and that by how much the more the vanity and emptineſs is and hath been, by ſo much the more will the ſubſtance and fulneſs be in the end; and that by how much the more we begin to be out of love with, and ſo to forſake, throw and caſt away that, we ſhall by ſo much the more, and the more readily, receive, love, and imbrace the truth and ſubſtance; and that the greater this exceſs of vanity hath been, the more eaſier and readier ſhall we part with it.</p>
            <p>I hope it hath well-nigh fulfilled its meaſure; ſin hath and doth abound exceedingly; our exceſſes in all things have been and are even to aſtoniſhment: I hope therefore, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>grace and truth ſhall ſo much
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115297:26"/>
the more ſuper abound.</hi> Yet, my brethren, let us not therefore ſin, or continue longer in theſe vanities and exceſſes. Have we not ſufficiently glutted our ſelves with the works and deeds of darkneſs and the night? I hope we have, and ſo ſhall now loath them ſo much the more.</p>
            <p>Brethren, the day appears, and the light is broken forth; look upon it, for it is very pleaſant to behold: and although we have been <hi>children toſſed to and fro with every winde,</hi> let us now be men, ſetled and ſtabliſhed upon ſuch a Rock and Foundation, from whence no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may, nor ought, nor muſt, nor can remove us. Let us no longer embrace folly, and deſpiſe wiſdom: I know them both; and give me leave to tell you, that wiſdom is all in all unto all things; and without it, there is not, neither indeed and in truth can there be any thing: It, and it onely doth all things in Heaven and in earth. I need not tell you what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of it, that you know ſo well as I; and dobtleſs he was a very wiſe man; yet, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Behold a wiſer then Solomon is here,</hi> whoſe wiſdom did excel the others much in many things, as might be ſhewed; but it is not convenient: therefore hear and follow him.</p>
            <p>Brethren, be not enemies to your ſelves; bar not up the gates, ſhut not up the doors againſt your ſelves: <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>cries out in the ſtreets</hi> unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one; ſhe would gladly poſſeſs you, and be poſſeſſed of you: you may have her if you pleaſe, ſhe offers her ſelf daily to you, if you will look after her and embrace her,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>It is enough.</l>
            </lg>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:115297:27"/>
            <p>But that which hath and doth trouble me moſt, is thoſe <hi>dividing principles;</hi> no, I will not call them ſo, but rather, <hi>dividing voices,</hi> whereby men, both by their ſpeakings and their writings, diſcover much of wrath and enmity. Yet here alſo am I ſomewhat comforted (for I may not by any means let go my hold) in that I hope alſo, that as the enmity hath greatly appeared and made manifeſt it ſelf; ſo, the reconciliation, love, and peace will manifeſt it ſelf exceeding abundantly much more: and therein I ſhall have the more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant recompence for all the grief, travail, and labour my ſoul hath ſuſtained by reaſon of theſe things, through the greatneſs of the joy and gladneſs which ſhall be multiplyed upon me thereby.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>For God is juſt ſtill.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Hitherto hath the Lord brought us, bleſſed be the God of <hi>Jacob;</hi> and we have not much farther to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, I hope, at this time.</p>
            <p>Concerning Government which is by Contract, a little diligence will eaſily finde out and diſcover, what the very true nature, property, and quality thereof is, In or upon what Center, baſis, ground, and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it truely ſtands, there being very little or no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between this, and that we have already made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after; therefore I have little elſe or more to ſay then I have ſaid already.</p>
            <p>But briefly, and as plainly as I can, it is thus: A Contract, if I miſtake not, is, the mutual conſent
<pb facs="tcp:115297:27"/>
and agreement of two or more, wherein they mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo far and ſo much give up their very true, proper, and real ſelves each unto other, and ſo become ſo much and ſo far one, in, with, and to each other, in and by that Contract, as the very, true, real, and certain doing and performing (ſo far as they are able) of the thing or things each unto other, and each with and for other, call for and require, as in and by the ſaid Contract is mutually agreed, ordained, and appointed by them.</p>
            <p>The which Contract now, is the onely and alone ground and foundation on which they both ſtand, the Center in which they have both met, tyed and bound their very true, real, and proper ſelves, each with other, and each unto other; in or unto which ſhould both their eys ſtand always fixed, leſt the one or the other ſhould forget, neglect, forſake and depart from it, and ſo from each other, their very, true, proper, and real ſelves, bound up in, and tyed faſt by that Contract.</p>
            <p>This their Contract now is become, made, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ordained, and conſtituted mutually by them both, the onely and alone Rule or Ruler, Guide and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of, unto, or over them both, ſo that neither the one nor the other, may, ought, or can exerciſe any act, do any thing unto each other, or require and exact any thing from each other, either this or that, either more or leſs then that Contract and Agreement rules, orders, governs, guides, and directs, both or each other unto.</p>
            <p>It may not be expected that I ſhould ſpeak to all the various kinds of Contracts particularly: what hath been already ſaid, with that which follows, will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <pb facs="tcp:115297:28"/>
compact, covenant, or agreement whatſoever, to walk uprightly with God and man; nor that I ſhould anſwer the ſeveral nice queſtions, ambiguous queries, and (may I not ſay) fooliſh ſcruples raiſed and made, by the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical heads, or rather rambling and licentious ſpirits of moſt faithleſs and unſtable men.</p>
            <p>Compacts, Covenants, and Oaths, in all times and ages of men, and of men of all kindes, qualities, and conditions in all parts of the world (as is cleer and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by their ſeveral hiſtories) have been generally held very ſacred; and I think it is no weak Argument, teſtimony, and proof thereof. That which all men uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally in all ages have agreed and conſented in, that may ſafely (eſpecially in a thing of this nature) be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a ſound and undeniable truth: and we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found a very great enmity, deteſtation, and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, conſtantly ariſing and appearing in all mankind, againſt Covenant breakers, inſomuch that they bare any thing, even murder it ſelf, better then that.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs they are very ſacred things, and the breach of them a very great wickedneſs and abomination, both in the ſight of God and man; you have the caſe of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> a very clear preſident, which alone, if duly weighed and conſidered with upright minds, would (I may I think preſume) anſwer all the queſtions doubts and diſputes that have been, are, or can be made in the caſe.</p>
            <p>The Gibeonites come and addreſs themſelves to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> and the Iſraelites, to make a league or peace with them, under the pretence of being a people of a far Country, and they dealt very craftily, as the Text ſaith, for they put on old garments and clouted ſhoos, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the matter: <hi>Our garments,</hi> ſay they, <hi>were new, but
<pb facs="tcp:115297:28"/>
behold they be rent; our bread and wine were new, but lo it is now mouldy and naught. Ioſhua</hi> puts it to them again and again: <hi>It may be,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you are Hivites, a people whom the Lord hath commanded us to root out and deſtroy: No,</hi> ſay they ſtill again and again, <hi>we are of a far Country;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they had their lives given them by Contract. The matter within three days being diſcovered, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation murmur againſt the Princes for it, and would have ſlain them: <hi>No,</hi> ſay the Princes, <hi>we have ſworn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, therefore you may not do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and the Princes might have ſaid amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Let the people do what they will, we will take no notice of it; they ought to have been ſlain, but they deceived us, and the people murmur againſt us, and are ſorely diſcontent: Or, they might have ſaid to the Gibeonites, You have lyed to us in all that you have ſaid and done, you told us you were a people of a far Country, and ſo deceived us; you are not the men we took you to be, nor that your ſelves ſaid you were; you have dealt falſly with us in this matter, pretending to be one thing when you were in truth another; we made no league with you, for you are Hivites, a people whom we are commanded by our God to deſtroy, and we may not, muſt not, dare not let you live, leſt we our ſelves dye: you are but a few, we are many; better a few who are our enemies, ſhould die, then the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> it was the people of a far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that we made a League and Covenant with, and in that capacity you ſtood before us, and in that capacity, and upon that account onely and alone, we made a League with you: you are a company of treacherous, falſe, deceitful fellows, and therefore deſerve a ſorer
<pb facs="tcp:115297:29"/>
death then others: No, the Oath is given, the League and Contract made, and muſt be kept &amp; performed, yea, and the breach thereof made by thoſe who were many generations after, was puniſhed upon the children of thoſe Fathers by whom the Covenant and League was made many generations before.</p>
            <p>And verily Contracts and Covenants extend farther, and reach higher then moſt men think. I do deſire ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly it may be conſidered by us; we are fallen into the times ſpoken of wherein Covenant-breakers ſhould abound; and verily, moſt men now adays leap over their ſeveral Contracts and Covenants, as if they were but ſtraws, and ſwallow the breach of them as ſweet morſels.</p>
            <p>Let it be examined and weighed; to him with whom I make a contract, if I be true and real in it, to him I give up my very true and real ſelf, ſo far and ſo much as that contract extends to, during the time thereof; and ſo if he give credit to, believe and receive my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, I do therein and thereby make and beget a very true and real eſſence in and unto him with whom I do ſo contract, and ſo he hath thereby made unto him as good an aſſurance of me, to be his very true and real ſelf, in reference to thoſe things contracted for, during the terme of the contract, as poſſibly it can be made and done.</p>
            <p>Therefore if we have made and entered into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and contract with any, Let us faithfully and fully (as we are able) yea, freely and willingly alſo make good and performe the ſame; let our loſs, damage, and detriment be what it will or can, it is our contract, and it muſt be kept; if any detriment, damage or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
<pb facs="tcp:115297:29"/>
ariſe to us in it or by it, that was our own fault, and we muſt therefore bear it; and let us not with <hi>Adam</hi> lay it upon another.</p>
            <p>For certainly, upon a due examination, ſearch, and inquiry, it will be found, that our ſelves in very deed, and in truth, are the proper and true cauſe of all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, troubles, ſorrows, afflictions, miſeries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whatſoever (call them as you pleaſe) that at preſent are, that ever did, or ever ſhall come upon, happen to, or befall us. In our ſelf lieth, and from our ſelf ariſeth and ſpringeth forth the root, ſeeds, ground, occaſion and cauſe of whatever befalleth every particular man of us: verily if it be rightly weighed and conſidered, it will be found ſo. <hi>Thy deſtruction is of thy ſelf, O Iſrael,</hi> ſaith the Lord; and ſo it's ſaid of <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in the caſe of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> that they counſelled not with the mouth of the Lord; which would a man alwayes in all things do, he would be alwayes and in all things ſafe and ſecure. Nor will it be found, I believe, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſay, that the other party or parties performe not, but break and falſifie with us: we notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt hold, keep, and performe with them, and nothing may, muſt, or can diſcharge and diſoblige, but the mutual conſent of the parties Covenanted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſay, Where, when, ſo much, ſo far, and ſo long as we may be free, let us not be bound.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:115297:30"/>
            <p>But if that we call neceſſity or conveniency, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to contract, know aſſuredly that it very greatly concerns us to be exceeding circumſpect, very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wary, how or upon what grounds we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; with whom, for what uſe and uſes, to what ends, and for what time. Verily a man in this caſe, of all the caſes I know in the world, had need have his eyes in his head, to counſel with the Lord, for it muſt or ought to be fully, thorowly, and perfectly done and performed, and that with all willingneſs, readineſs and chearfulneſs of minde alſo.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſhould then deſire, when we do enter Covenants, Contracts, and Agreements with any, that ſo much as we are able, they may be very juſt, right, true and equal unto all concerned therein: for aſſuredly, in juſtneſs, rightneſs, or righteouſneſs, conſiſts the all of man, his life, his ſtrength, his reſt, peace, and happineſs: if you have not a juſt, true, and even center, it is impoſſible you can be at caſe, at quiet, at reſt and peace, in it, nor can it give full and perfect life and ſtrength to the whole circumference: if the foundation be not plain and level, you cannot build a firm, ſtable, and laſting ſtructure upon it. God is juſt, juſtice it ſelf; God is right, or righteous; he is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs it ſelf.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:115297:30"/>
            <p>We ſay there is <hi>the Father, the Son, and the Spirit,</hi> and that <hi>theſe three are one;</hi> and it is written of Chriſt the Son, that <hi>he thought it no robbery to make himſelf equal with God.</hi> God did certainly make manifeſt himſelf in or by three diſtinct workings or operations, or as we ſay, three diſtinct perſons, or in a threefold diſtinct way and manner of operating rather, and theſe three, as we ſay, and ſay truely, are but one God: and certainly God is but one; and in one, or unity, conſiſteth all, all light, life, and ſtrength. So you ſee the Divinity ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth and conſiſteth in equality or oneneſs, and indeed otherwiſe it could not be.</p>
            <p>So doubtleſs mans being, if he will be and have a perfect, upright, ſtable, quiet, peaceable being, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to himſelf and others, it muſt be in equality or oneneſs (and the one is not, nor cannot be, without the other) as it is in God or the Divinity, who is the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and foundation to, and pattern of all things that be; and if the centers and foundations we make and lay, be in and upon him, they muſt be ſuch alſo; and if we build not upon him, it is impoſſible our build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can ſtand.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore, I beſeech you all, upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Contracts, minde this thing, and be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and wary, taking great heed leſt we lay a ground and foundation, a cauſe and occaſion of emulations, ſtrifes, and contentions; of murmurrings, repinings, and complainings, diſquiets and diſcontents. Verily, he who thinks he may have the advantage, that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he ſeemeth to have, will certainly prove his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115297:31"/>
diſadvantage: as ſuppoſe I would make my ſelf greater and higher (as we uſe to ſpeak) then the reſt in the Contract, doubtleſs (as I could make evidently to appear, but that I haſten) I give the greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the other, by ſo much as I make my ſelf greater or higher then he. And verily I believe the time is not far off, wherein there will, or at leaſt may be, as much conteſt, ſtrife, endeavour or deſire to be little or low in the world, as now there is to be great and high. Mans wiſdom is returning unto him, and he returning unto it; God is delivering the Creation from that bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage it hath ſo long lyen under, into the moſt <hi>glorious liberty of his ſons,</hi> which it ſo earneſtly groaneth for, and is in pain and travail at this day, being even in a readineſs to bring forth: he is <hi>bringing down,</hi> as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> excellently hath it, <hi>all things that are high and lofty,</hi> which are lifted up and exalted above their meaſure, beyond their right and true bounds and limits. And what is all this, or what doth it mean and ſpeak, but onely that he is reſtoring all things to that which they were in the beginning; reſtoring mankinde, and all things together with him, to their priſtine or primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive glory, beauty and excellency? Wherefore then ſhould any be troubled, fear, or be afraid at theſe tydings? O that men would ſtand ſtill a little, whilſt God is doing this thing! Let us conſider and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what the rule or pattern is which we are to be made after, levelled to, made even and one with: it is no other then the Lord himſelf, <hi>who is God bleſſed for ever.</hi> Shall we then fear or be afraid to be made one in and with the Lord, and one in and with another in him? What a perfect, full, and compleat union and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115297:31"/>
hamony of, in and with the whole Creation: what a glory, what a ſtrength, what a beaty, and excellency will this be; what a joyful ſhout will this make!</p>
            <p>Let us not therefore look upon God as an hard and evil maſter, as one that would hurt us and deſtroy us; for verily he never did, nor doth, nor (that I may ſpeak with reverence) poſſibly can hurt us; for it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary to his being: our hurt, our evil, our deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is onely and alone in, of, and from our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Our ſalvation only and alone in, of, and from him: <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>&amp;c. Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own concupiſcence, and is enticed. Then when luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin, and ſin when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death. Erre not, my dear brethren: Every good giving, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableneſs, neither ſhadow of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will therefore upon this account neither fear God nor man, but I will in all things, and at all times, greatly fear my ſelf, knowing moſt aſſuredly, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I hurt my ſelf, nothing elſe poſſibly can hurt me. I will therefore always, in all things, love him who is my ſalvation, even the Father of lights, from whom comes onely every good and perfect gift. Let us then with all readineſs and chearfulneſs of minde and heart, meet the Lord in this way of his exceeding
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115297:32"/>
great kindneſs, and uttermoſt extent of his love to us.</p>
            <p>I do admire, that I ſay not adore; but verily I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reverence the wiſdom, prudence, providence, juſtneſs, and up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>-rightneſs, that is, the high perfection in righteouſneſs in our forefathers in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as is to be plainly found, ſeen, known, and read in the Laws, Ordinances, Cuſtoms, and Conſtitutions of this Nation; which know not, neither may they know any diſtinction or difference of perſons; for they are all one there in the Center; and right and juſtice is commanded and required to be done to all, to all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and alike (as is known unto all:) however other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as they lye in the circumference, in reference to the body known and diſtinguiſhed, as being ſuch or ſuch a member, bearing ſuch and ſuch an Office or place in and unto the body, or Commonwealth, yet there, as is ſaid before, they muſt return and account, as to the whole, ſo to every particular member thereof, grieved, wronged, or offended.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be ſorry to ſee any people in the world, in whom ſo manifold and great tranſgreſſions, ſins, and iniquities of their own and forefathers ſhould be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up and centered together in one, as to be put to ſuch ſtraits and extremities for their deliverance, as to enter into ſuch a Contract with any man, as <hi>Nahaſh</hi> the Ammonite required of the men of <hi>Iabeſh Gilead,</hi> that he might put out their right eys: but he loſt his end, and the people were delivered another way, and by another hand. I deny not but that ſuch a thing may poſſibly be, for God is juſt, yet he is merciful alſo. I will therefore
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115297:32"/>
hope of a more plain and even path unto <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and more viſible for that peoples deliverance: but more may appear hereafter.</p>
            <p>Verily there is one thing lies extream hard and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon me in reference to this Nation, and ſticks very much with me; and that is the breath of Agreements, Covenants, and Contracts. Verily it grieves me at the very ſoul, and pains me at the heart: I know not where to lay it in particular; but verily there is no leſs then the price of blood lies ſomewhere: none are ignorant of the unheard of breaches of the Publick Faith of the Nation, (which verily ſhould have been deerer to us then our lives) brought to nothing, made baſe and contemptible: the Contracts made with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral the ſouldiery of the Nation, who upon thoſe Contracts went continually in jeopardy of their lives, loſt their limbs and lives, many of them, left their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies deſolate and forſaken, and many of them who have eſcaped with their lives, have after all been ready to famiſh for bread, and their families alſo. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Covenants, Contracts, and Articles made with and given to thoſe who engaged againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, extream vilely and baſely violated. Verily theſe things lye heavy and hard; yet have I ſeen theſe things made a merriment and laughter, even by ſome of thoſe whom it did moſt neerly and properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to ſee made good, and performed. Can it be ſaid truly, There wanted power and ability to perform? Verily I wiſh it could be ſo ſaid in truth; but I fear it will be found otherwiſe. Oh what, Oh what ſhall we do in this caſe? O that my blood could ſatisfie in this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115297:33"/>
thing! Let us remember what <hi>David</hi> did when the water for which he longed was brought unto him; <hi>He pours it upon the ground, ſaying, It is the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives;</hi> and therefore would not drink of it. Surely to eat the ſweat of another mans brows, would be very unpleaſant, harſh, ſowre, and hard, to him who is of an upright heart and mind; and very unrighteous and unjuſt alſo, except inability neceſſitate thereunto: but to eat and drink not onely the ſweat, but the blood of others alſo, verily it is a moſt great and grievous wickedneſs, an horrible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs and impiety. I earneſtly beg, pray, and beſeech, that a very diligent, due, and exact in quiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or enquiry be made concerning this matter; and Oh that it might be done ſtilly, and quietly, yet effectually and throughly; that it might be done with meekneſs and gentleneſs of ſpirit, in much wiſdom and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raton, yet faithfully and uprightly. May not this quarrel and controverſie, this great ſtrife and conteſt (I will hope it may) yet be taken up, if it be done in time? Verily I hope wrath may be aſſwaged, the great and grievous cries, yea and juſt ones too, both of the dead and living, may be appeaſed, ſatisfaction given, and an atonement made in this caſe. Oh that it may not onely be done as to the matter, but that it may be juſtly done as to the way and manner alſo! that we do not injuſtice to one, to ſatisfie another. Perhaps leſs, much leſs then their Contracts were, and in juſtice they might require, will appeaſe, quiet, ſatisfic, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and thereby thoſe now whoſe blood, whoſe lives, whoſe ſorrows, whoſe troubles, miſeries and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cry and call mightily, and that every day, for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115297:33"/>
wrath, judgement, and deſtruction, will return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, ſtrengthen our hands and hearts, and their very ſouls bleſs and pray for us. Verily if this thing be but done, all is done; and then will peace and joy, health, ſtrength, life, and ſalvation, break forth migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily upon us; and the glory of the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords will reſt upon us, walk continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with us, and before us, and no fear ſhall or can come nigh us: the Heavens would then give down their rain, and the earth, which begins to be burnt up, give forth its fatneſs.</p>
            <p>Verily I am not in jeſt in this matter; it is a buſineſs of the higheſt concernment to the Nation that can be: and as the Lord God who made Heaven and earth lives, before whom, and in whoſe preſence I now ſtand, I do more earneſtly beg this thing of every one whom it doth concern, then I would or could do for my own life, and the lives of all the particular, neereſt and deareſt relations I have in the world.</p>
            <p>And I beſeech you, think not that I am in ſome fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh pang or paſſion, or that theſe expreſſions ariſe from a melancholy diſcontented minde and ſpirit: no; they are the words of ſoberneſs, and words that proceed from the very heart and ſoul, where verily theſe things lye deeply rooted; I am my ſelf, upon all accounts whatſoever, and I know what I ſpeak in that which I have ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Oh that I could but ſee ſome begin to move this way! Surely they would be met and ſeconded by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I hope by all. Verily there is no way to ſave and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115297:34"/>
ſecure your ſelves and eſtates, but this, To ask mercy and pardon of the Lord and your brethren, to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and reſtitution, wherein you have done amiſs, and it is good, honourable, and commendable in the ſight of God and man: and ſurely Engliſhmen are not (I am ſure were not, in times paſt) hard of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Verily I hope we ſhall all be found men of ſuch nobleneſs of minde, men of ſuch honour, men of ſo great and magnanimous ſpirits, that we ſhall reckon and account it much beſides and below our ſelves, to be overcome with or by any injuries, wrongs, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, as we call them, whatſoever: but I truſt we ſhall be found men of ſuch and ſo great minds and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that we can eaſily and readily ſwallow up and drown them all in our own breaſts and boſoms, there to be buried, ſo, as never to riſe any more.</p>
            <p>Why, Oh why may we not ſay to the greateſt and worſt of our enemies, <hi>Live?</hi> Oh come and let us again like brethren live, and live together, even we and our forefathers, we in them, they in us, both, all, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Laws, Ordinances, Cuſtoms, and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions they have ordained, appointed, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us, and all generations after us for ever; for which ſo much blood of our forefathers hath been ſhed, ſo many and ſo great hazards and adventures by them run, ſo much witneſſed to and conteſted for by many noble, worthy, true Engliſhmen; and for which ſuch and ſo great a hazard and adventure hath now again been run, ſuch (may I not ſay as it were) a Sea of blood ſhed, and exceeding vaſt treaſure ſpent for the defence or ſecuring thereof, and our ſelves therein.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:115297:34"/>
            <p>This was the end, this is the end; and I truſt none will be deceived of it, but that all of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or intereſts whatſoever, or howſoever now (may I not ſay unhappily?) diſtinguiſhed, ſhall really and truly finde, have it, and know it ſo: Wherefore I beg, and beg again, again, and again, that we may all now, as one man, joyn together for ever, ſo to ſecure thoſe the Laws, Ordinances, Cuſtoms, and Conſtitutions of our forefathers, and our ſelves and poſteritie for ever hereafter in them, that both our ſelves and ours may live in peace, reſt and happineſs for ever after, and no man or men whatſoever, may once ſo much as dare to offer or attempt the leaſt interruption, alteration, breach, or violation thereof: for, he who touches them, touches our lives wrapped up in them.</p>
            <p>Verily it is greatly the honour, nobility, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of a man, to paſs by offences and injuries. Have we not broken one anothers heads and arms, in breaking the Ordinances of our forefathers, even broke one another almoſt quite in pieces? Why let us piece and reconcile again, like Engliſhmen for ever hereafter: and away with thoſe low, baſe, beggerly, vile, unworthy, mercenary, or mechanick-ſpirited men, as we call them, who are ſo far from this honour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and dignity of men, or Engliſhmen, that they have unworthily injured, wronged, oppreſſed, cheated, ſtoln, &amp; robbed, to ſatisfic their vain, empty, fond, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh appetites, luſts, &amp; pleaſures. We may not call theſe Engliſhmen, untill they repent and return; thoſe who have been ſo far from ſaving and keeping whole, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115297:35"/>
and protecting the Faith of the Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to their power, that they have, as much as in them lay, extreamly and moſt perfidioufly viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame in all caſes, and upon all accounts whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Which, think you, is the more noble, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, gallant, excellent man, he that thus injures, wrongs, and oppreſſes another man, or he who bears, ſwallows up, buries and overcomes ſuch oppreſſions, wrongs, and injuries?</p>
            <p>Ariſe thou man, Oh thou man of glory, of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and of beauty; thou, Oh thou man of power, of dignity, and of ſtrength, and come, and ſtand forth in the midſt of us, to ſave us and deliver us, for we are nigh unto periſhing. He, even he, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be moved with or by any thing or all things from his glory, his dignity, his excellency, ſtrength, and ſtedfaſtneſs.</p>
            <p>Come, Oh come: we who have been oppreſſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, and wronged, we will freely forgive it and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it; it ſhall no more be thought of by us, but we will bury it for ever; we will not ſo much reproach our ſelves and our Maker; we will not ſo debaſe our ſelves, nor defile our houſes, habitations, and temples, as to keep or harbour in them the low, baſe, vile, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, unworthy dealings of other men towrds us and by us.</p>
            <p>No, we will ſurely retain our honour, our glory, our excellency and dignity unſpotted, unſtained, and undefiled: we will, ſo far as we are able, forgive it

alſo, for our fathers, friends, and relations: onely we beg, pray, and beſeech, for your own ſakes, that you will not let any thing lye upon your own ſcore and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, which is in your own power to remedy and help, for you are of ourſelves: we are a body, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; and it is the Common-weal or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good that we defire and ſeek, of which we hope you will continue members: and can any member of the body be in danger, and we not ſenſible? Lord, how can it be? hence it is we ſo love and pity you. Oh why ſhould a farther breach be made amongſt us? He who hath the Wedge of Gold, or the Babyloniſh Garment, let it be done away: if you have that which you cannot ſay with a perfect and upright heart, in the fight of the Sun, is juſtly, duely, truly, honeſtly, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gotten and obtained, let it be done away and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, parted with and departed from, leſt wrath break forth and conſume you utterly, ſo that nor you nor yours have either name or place in <hi>England.</hi> Why, Oh why will you die? Why will you make your ſelvs and be made a ſcorn and reproach in and unto <hi>England,</hi> yea, and unto your ſelves alſo? Who, Oh who is he that beginneth firſt? doubtleſs, that mans face ſhall ſhine and be glorious above many: verily the Sun is ariſing, if not already up, which will certainly diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the precious and the vile, between the noble and ignoble, between the honourable and the baſe: the night is even almoſt quite ſpent and gone.</p>
            <p>My ſoul greatly ſtoops, bows, and bends it ſelf, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the gates of death, that it might bring you life; I have come down in all things; ſo far as I was

            <p>Men, Fathers, and brethren; all, however known, called, or diſtinguiſhed, I have endeavoured that we might finde out a cleer, even, and perfect path for all to walk in: I have endeavoured to ſhew you the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, equity, and righteouſneſs of it; I have layed meat unto you, brought you to your foundation, to your center, to your Fathers houſe, where is bread and meat, food enough; and this in love to you. I hope, by our ſeeking and enquiry, we have found and brought forth the things which are truly, really, and certainly, in their own nature, eſſence, and being, juſt, right, and true, and ſo your moſt aſſured ſtrength, reſt, peace, and happineſs; and therein I truſt made manifeſt ſuch a perfect, abſolute, undeniable, compleat Righteouſneſs, as will ſtand, hold, and endure the tryal both of the Winde and Sun, endeavouring as much as in me lies, to give you eys to ſee it ſo; which ſhould I not have done, I ſhould have judged my ſelf to have fallen ſhort.</p>
            <p>I have now fully ended, having been exceeding much larger then I intended, deſiring that none will be offended at any thing herein, but that all the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and infirmities, faults and eſcapes, committed by
